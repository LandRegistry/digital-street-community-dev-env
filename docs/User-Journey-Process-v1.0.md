### Digital Street User Journey Process Flow Map v1.0

Digital Street User Journey Process Flow Map v1.0 - This is a user journey for a simple asset transfer and contract based on 5 actors:
* Buyer
* Seller
* Conveyancer (Buyer)
* Conveyancer (Seller)
* HM Land Registry

The Process starts with an offline conversation between the seller and sellerâ€™s conveyancer to act on behalf of the Seller. It is assumed that any ID verification has been completed before this process, and that an offer on the property has already been agreed.

It is split into three sections:
* Requesting the land title onto the ledger, and giving the conveyancer access 
* Drafting and agreeing the contract
* Exchange of contracts and transfer completion
